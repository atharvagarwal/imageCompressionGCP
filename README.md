# imageCompression
Image compression system
To run it you must have node.js installed on your system

Software Working- We can send the files to backend in zip format and once the files are compressed on the backend we can download it in zip format. 
For ex - if we send files in format of image->productId->color->name.png , it get outputted as 
output.zip->Images->image->productId->color->name.png in compressed format .
